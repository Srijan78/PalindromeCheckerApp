# PalindromeCheckerApp
# Objective

The objective of the Palindrome Checker App is to design and implement a console-based Java application that checks whether a given string is a palindrome using different logical approaches.
This project helps in strengthening core programming fundamentals such as strings, arrays, loops, and algorithm efficiency.

# Project Procedure 

Created a structured Java application for palindrome validation.
Implemented different use cases to check palindrome under various conditions.
Used version control with Git and GitHub to manage the project.
Applied concepts like loops, string manipulation, character arrays, and efficient comparison techniques.
Tested the program with different inputs and verified correctness.
Maintained clean coding practices and modular design.

# Project Flow
The application starts and displays a welcome message.
The user provides a string input.
The program processes the input using different palindrome checking methods.
Each use case applies a different algorithm.
The result is displayed to the user.
The application can be extended with optimized methods and additional features.

# Use Cases Implemented
✅ UC1 – Application Entry & Welcome Message

Displays the application name, version, and startup information.

✅ UC3 – Reverse String Method

Reverses the string using a loop and compares it with the original.

✅ UC4 – Character Array Two-Pointer Method

Converts the string into a character array and compares characters from both ends, improving efficiency.

# Outcome

This project improves understanding of Java basics, problem-solving skills, and efficient algorithm design. It also demonstrates how the same problem can be solved using multiple approaches with different time and memory considerations.
